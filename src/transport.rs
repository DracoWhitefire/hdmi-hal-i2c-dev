/// Implements [`ScdcTransport`] by issuing SMBus operations (`I2C_SMBUS`) to the
/// SCDC slave address (0x54) on the specified adapter: byte-data reads and writes,
/// and I²C block reads for [`read_block`](ScdcTransport::read_block). Each read is one
/// ioctl asking for a combined write-then-read — the register offset written, a repeated
/// START, the bytes read — the transaction an SCDC read is on the wire.
///
/// # Block reads
///
/// Opened with [`open`](Self::open), `read_block` is one SMBus I2C block read
/// (`I2C_SMBUS_I2C_BLOCK_DATA`): one ioctl, handed to the kernel whole. What reaches the
/// wire is the adapter driver's, not this crate's:
///
/// - Checked to put it on the wire as one transaction: the DRM DDC adapters of `i915`
///   (GMBUS) and `amdgpu` (DC), through the kernel's SMBus emulation (the offset write and
///   a repeated-START read). `amdgpu` was also checked on hardware.
/// - Known to split it: the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI controller's I²C master
///   (`dw-hdmi`, and `dw-hdmi-qp`; i.MX, Rockchip, Allwinner and Amlogic boards) reads
///   one byte per hardware operation, each with its own offset write, while advertising
///   the block read. There `read_block` returns `Ok`, but its registers were read one at a
///   time; only the CED checksum (culvert) can show a torn read.
/// - Others are unchecked.
///
/// Its limit is [`MAX_BLOCK_LEN`], 32 bytes (`I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX`): a longer buffer is
/// [`I2cDevError::BlockReadTooLong`], before any ioctl, never split. There is no fallback
/// to one register at a time: an adapter without the SMBus I2C block read
/// (`I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_I2C_BLOCK`, as on some SMBus-only adapters) fails the ioctl,
/// typically with [`I2cErrorKind::Unsupported`], and the error is returned. On such an
/// adapter, open the transport with [`open_bytewise`](Self::open_bytewise) instead.
///
/// Past register 0xFF the result is the sink's on real hardware; `i2c-stub` ends the read
/// at 0xFF, which is [`I2cDevError::UnexpectedBlockLength`].
///
/// # Error recovery
///
/// A [`I2cDevError::Transaction`] error does not invalidate the transport. The
/// underlying file descriptor remains open and subsequent calls may succeed.
/// If errors persist, the sink has most likely disconnected; drop and
/// reconstruct the transport via [`I2cDevTransport::open`].
